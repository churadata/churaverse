# WebRTC configuration
rtc:
    # when set, LiveKit enable WebRTC ICE over TCP when UDP isn't available
    # this port *cannot* be behind load balancer or TLS, and must be exposed on the node
    # WebRTC transports are encrypted and do not require additional encryption
    # only 80/443 on public IP are allowed if less than 1024
    tcp_port: 7881
    # when set, LiveKit will attempt to use a UDP mux so all UDP traffic goes through
    # a single port. This simplifies deployment, but mux will become an overhead for
    # highly trafficked deployments.
    # port_range_start & end must not be set for this config to take effect
    udp_port: 7882
    # when set to true, attempts to discover the host's public IP via STUN
    # this is useful for cloud environments such as AWS & Google where hosts have an internal IP
    # that maps to an external one
